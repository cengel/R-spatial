# Prerequisites and Preparations {-}

To get the most out of this workshop you should have:

- a **basic knowledge** of R and/or be familiar with the topics covered in the [Introduction to R](https://cengel.github.io/R-intro/).
- have a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed. 

**Recommended**: 

- Create a new RStudio project `R-spatial` in a new folder `R-spatial`.

- Create a new folder under `R-spatial` and call it `data`. 

- Open up a new R Script file and call it `R-spatial.R` for the code you'll create during the workshop.

- If you have your working directory set to `R-spatial` which contains a folder called `data` you can copy, paste, and run the following lines in R:

```{r download-files, eval=FALSE}
download.file("http://bit.ly/R-spatial-data", "R-spatial-data.zip")
unzip("R-spatial-data.zip", exdir = "data")
```

You can also download the data manually here [R-spatial-data.zip](https://github.com/cengel/R-spatial/raw/master/data/R-spatial-data.zip) and extract them in the `data` folder.
 
- Install and load the following libraries: 
    - [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) 
    - [`terra`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=terra)
    - [`tidyverse`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse)

- For the mapping section install and load these additional libraries:
    - [`classInt`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=classInt)
    - [`RColorBrewer`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RColorBrewer)
    - [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tmap)
    - [`leaflet`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet)
